## Step 5: Start Using It!

### Fetch Your Emails
- The app will automatically fetch recent emails
- Or type: "fetch emails" in the chat

### Ask Questions
Try these examples:
- "Show me recent emails from John"
- "What did Sarah say about the meeting?"
- "Find emails about the project"

### Draft a Reply
1. Ask to see emails: "Show me recent emails"
2. Click "Draft Reply" on any email
3. Enter your instruction: "Say I'm interested and available next week"
4. Review and refine the draft
5. Click "Send Email"

### Compose New Email
Type in the chat:
- "Compose an email to john@example.com about the meeting"
- "Write a professional introduction email"

## Troubleshooting

### "This app isn't verified" warning
- This is normal! It's your own app
- Click "Advanced" â†’ "Go to AI Email Assistant (unsafe)"
- This warning appears because you haven't submitted the app for Google's verification (which you don't need for personal use)

### Can't find credentials.json
- Make sure it's in: `/home/ubuntu/jace-clone/credentials/credentials.json`
- Check the filename is exactly `credentials.json` (not `credentials (1).json`)

### Server won't start
- Check if port 8000 is already in use
- Try: `lsof -i :8000` to see what's using it
- Kill the process or use a different port

### No emails showing
- Wait 10-20 seconds after adding account
- Check the stats in the sidebar
- Try typing "fetch emails" manually

## Tips for Best Results

### For Better Email Drafts
- Be specific in your instructions
- Mention the tone: "formal", "casual", "friendly"
- Include key points: "mention the deadline and ask for confirmation"

### For Better Search
- Use natural language
- Include names, dates, or topics
- Be specific: "emails from last week about the budget" vs "recent emails"

### For Refinement
- Use the refinement box in the draft editor
- Try: "make it shorter", "add a greeting", "be more enthusiastic"
- Refine multiple times until perfect

## What's Next?

### Add Multiple Accounts
- Click "+ Add Account" again
- Use different IDs: "work", "personal", "side-project"
- Switch between them when composing

### Explore Features
- Try semantic search: "Find emails where someone thanked me"
- Ask complex questions: "What are the main topics in my recent emails?"
- Compose from scratch: "Write a follow-up email for the proposal I sent"
